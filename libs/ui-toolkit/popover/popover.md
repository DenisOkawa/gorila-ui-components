Enhanced titles are the title for pages compounds of two parts, where you can highlight half of it as you want.

### Normal part of the title

```html
<enhanced-title [title]="'normal text'"></enhanced-title>
```

### Highlighted part of the title

```html
<enhanced-title [highlight]="'highlighted text'"></enhanced-title>
```
